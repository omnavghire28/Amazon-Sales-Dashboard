# Amazon-Sales-Dashboard
The Amazon Sales Dashboard is a data-driven project designed to analyze sales trends, profitability, and market performance across multiple years. This dashboard provides an insightful breakdown of sales projections, quantities sold, and total profit from 2012 to 2015, helping businesses track growth and optimize their strategies. Key metrics such as the most sold item, sum of profit by market, and top-performing product categories showcase regional differences in profitability across markets like Europe, Asia Pacific, USCA, LATAM, and Africa.

The dashboard further categorizes sales by sub-category, highlighting essential consumer preferencesâ€”where items like phones, copiers, chairs, bookcases, and storage solutions consistently rank among the best-selling products. Additionally, monthly sales patterns offer a granular view of seasonal fluctuations, helping businesses identify peak selling periods. With structured tables illustrating sales, profits, and quantities per category, this dashboard serves as a valuable tool for data-driven decision-making, ensuring better financial forecasting and resource allocation.
